		CKEditor 4 Skin Contest - Instructions</h1>
	<p>
		Welcome to the CKEditor 4 Skin Contest. The contest page can be found at the following
		URL:<br>
		<a href="http://ckeditor4skin.strutta.com">http://ck4skin.strutta.com</a></p>
	<h2>
		Contents of this ZIP file</h2>
	<p>
		This file includes the necessary technical instructions and tools to properly participate
		in the contest. It contains a special distribution of CKEditor 4 Beta, with the
		following folders that are relevant for custom skin development:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b><a href="skins/kama/">skins/kama/</a></b>: the source code of the current default
			skin of CKEditor. This one can be used as the starting point of a custom skin.</li>
		<li><b><a href="dev/skintuner/index.html">dev/skintuner/</a></b>: the tool used to help
			develop and test custom skins. It is also necessary when taking the screenshot
			to post when entering the contest online.</li>
		<li><b><a href="samples/index.html">samples/</a></b>: custom skins can also be tested
			through the set of examples available in this folder.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Creating a Custom Skin</h2>
	<p>
		Creating a custom skin is a straightforward process. Please check the online <a href="http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_4.x/Skin_SDK">
			CKEditor 4 Skin SDK</a> for full information.</p>
	<h2>
		Taking a Screenshot</h2>
	<p>
		Once your skin is perfect and ready, it is time to show it to the world and enter
		the contest. For that you&#39;ll need a screenshot of it.</p>
	<p>
		To standardize the way skins are presented in the contest, all participants are
		required to use the <a href="dev/skintuner/index.html">Skin Tuner tool</a> to showcase
		their skins. The <a href="dev/skintuner/index.html">Skin Tuner</a> is a powerful
		tool that shows several different aspects of the skin in a single page.</p>
	<p>
		The screenshot of the <a href="dev/skintuner/index.html">Skin Tuner</a> page must
		include the full contents of the iframe space of that page, which include all skin
		part samples. This can&#39;t be easily achieved without a helper tool.</p>
	<p>
		We recommend using Firefox with the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireshot/">
			FireShot Add-On</a> to take the screenshot properly. Just right click inside
		the Skin Tuner and select &quot;FireShot &gt; Capture Entire page and ... &gt; Save
		...&quot;. Then save it as a png file.</p>
	<p>
		Of course, if you are able to produce png screenshots of the entire page using other
		tools, that&#39;s ok as well, as long as the final result looks similar.</p>
	<p>
		A sample screenshot can be found at <a href="dev/sample-screenshot.png">dev/sample-screenshot.png</a>.</p>
	<h2>
		Entering the Contest</h2>
	<p>
		With the screenshot in your hands, it is time to enter the contest. Just click the
		&quot;ENTER NOW&quot; button at the <a href="http://ck4skin.strutta.com">CKEditor 4
			Skin Contest page</a> and good luck!</p>
